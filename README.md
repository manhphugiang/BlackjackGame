Gameplay
Start the Game:

Launch the game to begin.
You'll be dealt two cards face up, and the dealer will have one card face up and one face down.
Player Turn:

Choose whether to 'Hit' (take another card) or 'Stand' (keep your current hand).
Aim to get as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.
Dealer Turn:


Once you stand, the dealer will reveal their facedown card and draw cards until their hand value is 17 or higher.
Outcome:


If your hand value is higher than the dealer's without exceeding 21, you win.
If your hand exceeds 21, you bust and lose the game.
If the dealer busts, you win.
If both you and the dealer have the same hand value, it's a push (tie).
